# Forecasting snow depth with prophet

Prophet is a great tool for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fitted with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. Considering climate change, I was wondering if this tool can be used to predict snow depth evolution in the French Alps and particularly in the French ski resorts. Obviously, this is not scientifically significant since weather prediction is a sophisticated task based on the Lorenz equations that govern the weather system but it is clearly fun to play with these data.
